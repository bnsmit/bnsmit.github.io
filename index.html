                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am from a town in Missouri with a population less than 1800.
                      I moved to Orlando after I graduated to be somewhere new. Now I 
                      work at Starbucks and go to ASU. Most of my free time is spent 
                      with my dog and my friends.

                    <h2>My Goals</h2>
                    <p>My first goal is to get finished with my Media Arts and Sciences 
                        degree here at ASU. After that, I hope to find a job that I am 
                        comfortable in that allows me to be creative or gives me enough 
                        time to be creative in my personal life.
